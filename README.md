* Modified the awesome-cv.cls slightly 
* Removed the list numbering for publications.
* Focusing on updating the cv using csvs and bib files.
* Styling your publications using given csl file in `YAML`.
* Printing as many bibliographic sections and corresponding entries as you want in your CV (e.g., journal publication, conference proceedings, software developments, etc. etc.).
* Highlighting your name in printed bib entries using bold format (see and change the content in `lua/strong.lua`).
