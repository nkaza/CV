abstract = { Often urban compactness indexes ignore the variegated intensity of urban development in their focus on the configuration. In this article, I propose an extension to the index of moment of inertia (IMI) as a compactness measure that can account for multiple ordinal classes representing development intensity. I demonstrate this index for developed areas for each county in the contiguous United States. These counties have a range of development configurations and intensity compositions. I show that for this data set, ignoring the multiple class composition and only focusing on the configuration overestimates the urban compactness in almost all instances. I demonstrate the impact of different analytical choices on the index for this data set. }

@article{Branham:2022te,
	abstract = {Federal, state, and local government funding helps stimulate urban development, with growth machine politics playing an important role in determining where subsidies are allocated. The U.S. Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) was enacted to curb the role of federal subsidies in fostering development along hazardous coastal barriers, providing an opportunity to explore how local growth politics are influenced by the removal of one source of government funding. In this study, we used a series of interview-based case studies to investigate why certain areas in the CBRA developed while most did not. In most cases, the CBRA obstructed local growth coalitions, isolating landowners from the resources necessary to improve the growth potential of their land interests. However, in cases where development occurred within the CBRA, we often found evidence that powerful growth machines were able to acquire replacement subsidies from state and local governments, suggesting these actions are a key driver in overcoming the financial barriers posed by the CBRA.

Takeaway for practice: This study revealed how growth machines could be hampered by removing access to the financial resources of one level of government, despite the potential to be undermined by intervention at other levels. In an era of increasing coastal risks, subsidy removal can be an effective tool for managing coastal growth, even when authority over land use decisions is limited.},

@article{Hino:2023uq,
	abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: Limiting housing and infrastructure in flood-prone places has long been recognized as critical to managing long-term risk. However, due to the difficulty of tracking development at small spatial scales, little empirical research has been conducted to explain differences between communities? floodplain development patterns. We analyzed new construction across 5 million parcels in the state of North Carolina to develop standardized measures of floodplain development and evaluated the relationships between flood risk management effort and development outcomes. Statewide, for every property removed through buyouts from 1996 to 2017, more than 10 new residences were built in floodplains. At the community level, indicators of flood risk management effort (participation in the Community Rating System and use of buyouts) did not consistently align with floodplain development outcomes. Based on a sample of urban and suburban counties, we found more than 75,000 acres of vacant floodplain land currently zoned for development. Although we did not capture the full range of flood risk mitigation practices, results indicate that local development policies often run counter to efforts to limit long-term risk.

Takeaway for practice: Land use planning and floodplain management have the potential to play a larger role in flood risk mitigation. Modifying federal programs to more strongly disincentivize floodplain development could enhance local regulation and minimize future flood exposure. Given extensive undeveloped floodplain land and projected climate change, additional effort to manage development is needed to limit increases in flood risk.},

@article{branhamRemovingFederalSubsidies2021,
	abstract = {The federal government has implemented a variety of policies and subsidies that help coastal development remain viable, including investments in risk reduction measures, subsidized flood insurance, and post-disaster assistance. In this study, we explore how the removal of federal subsidies impacts coastal development patterns by measuring the causal effect of the U.S. Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) on building activity. Implemented in 1982, CBRA withdrew eligibility for federal funding for infrastructure, post-disaster assistance, and subsidized flood insurance along designated sections of coastal barriers (``CBRA units''). Using a novel built structures dataset, we employ a spatial regression discontinuity design to compare development rates inside and outside CBRA units in 1980 and 2016. We demonstrate that CBRA has caused significant reductions in development activity, with development rates in CBRA more than 75\% lower than areas outside CBRA. Our findings suggest that policies like CBRA can be effective at slowing development in other sensitive or hazardous areas, and could help to preserve natural environments for habitat conservation and climate adaptation purposes.},

The US Office of Management and Budget categorization of counties into metropolitan/micropolitan central/outlying is widely seen as insufficient for many analytic purposes. In this paper we use coreness index from network analysis to identify labor market centrality of a county. We use county-to-county commute flows, including internal commuting, to identify regional hierarchies. Indicators broken down by this typology reveal counterintuitive results in many cases. Population size and level of urbanisation is largely irrelevant to strong core counties. Employment in these strong core counties grew faster in the post-recession (2008-2015) than other types, that is missed by other typologies, suggesting that this categorization may be useful for regional analysis and policy. },

@article{Branham:2021CB,
	abstract = {Shoreline armoring, which involves the installation of hardened structures to protect coastal property, dramatically alters shoreline composition and resulting ecological functions. Accelerating hazard threats to growing coastal communities compounds this problem, creating demand for more armoring. We examine whether designation by the U.S. Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) -- enacted to disincentivize urban development on hazardous coastal barriers -- is associated with lower propensities to armor shorelines. In designated areas, CBRA removes access to federally-subsidized flood insurance, infrastructure subsidies, and disaster assistance. Using logistic regression modeling, we examine armoring at the parcel scale across the State of Florida (USA), controlling for CBRA designation, land use, and local population density. Our findings reveal a significant negative relationship between CBRA designation and the odds of armoring, particularly for residential and vacant properties. As coastal areas grapple with increasing impacts from coastal hazards, removal of public subsidies may be an effective non-regulatory method for maintaining the ecological and protective benefits of natural shorelines.},

Rarely have investigators used a national sample and explicitly addressed whether people use neighborhood food stores to purchase food. Even more rarely have previous studies accounted for the broader built environment characteristics in which people live, access resources, socialize, and shop for food. We examined whether the cross-sectional associations between availability of neighborhood convenience stores and supermarkets and self-reported household annual expenditures for snacks and beverages still held after including regional destination accessibility, availability and diversity of neighborhood destinations, and neighborhood street connectivity. Our study included 49,048 households in 2010, located in 378 metropolitan areas in the continental United States. Households purchased more snacks if they lived in neighborhoods with many convenience stores. Access to unhealthy food includes a consideration of geographic proximity. The broader built environment characteristics was associated with food purchase, although the magnitude was small. },

This research explores the use of machine learning methods to forecast hourly water demand using smart meter data at the user-level. Random Forests (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are applied to forecast demand using predictors that include lagged demand, seasonality, weather, and household characteristics. Time-series clustering is applied to differentiate the time of day and days of the week, which improves model performance. Two modeling approaches are compared. Individual models are developed separately for each smart meter, and a group model is trained using a dataset of multiple meters. The approaches perform similarly well. Individual models predict demands at specific meters with lower error, while the group model predicts demands at new meters with lower error. Results demonstrate that RF and ANN perform better than SVR across all scenarios.},

Our method identifies regions with varying sizes as well as highly overlapping regions. Some counties belong to as many as six different statistically significant clusters but some do not belong to any.

I proxy the consumption with retail sales from gas stations for most of the conterminous United States at a county level. Using both demographic, economic and landscape characteristics of urban form I tease out the effect of different dimensions on energy consumption.

The 1982 US Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CoBRA) prohibits federal financial assistance for infrastructure, post-storm disaster relief, and flood insurance in designated sections (system units) of coastal barriers.  How has CoBRA's removal of these subsidies affected rates and types of urban development? Using building footprint and real estate data (n=1,385,552 parcels), we compare density of built structures, land use types, and land values within and outside of system units in eight southeastern US states. Here we show that CoBRA is associated with reduced development rates in coastal barrier zones, but also reveal how withdrawal of federal subsidies might be counteracted by local responses. As attention increases towards improving development policy in high hazard areas, this work contributes to understanding how limitations on infrastructure subsidies can affect outcomes under overlapping jurisdictions with competing goals.},

	abstract = {Abstract While urban form affects building energy consumption, the pathways, direction and magnitude of the effect are disputed in the literature. This paper uses a unique dataset to examine the effect of urban form on residential electricity consumption in Ningbo, China. Using survey and utility bill data of 534 households in 46 neighborhoods in the city, we model the electricity use of households using a multi-level regression model. We find that neighborhood street configuration and tree shade are important in controlling residential electricity consumption and, consequently, greenhouse gas emissions. Our results suggest that seasonality and dwelling type condition the effect of neighborhood densities on electricity consumption. Neighborhood density is associated with household electricity consumption in summer months, while there is no such association in the winter months. As neighborhood density increases, households in slab and tower apartments in dense urban neighborhoods consume more electricity in summer months, which can be partly explained by exacerbated heat island effect. Interestingly, the neighborhood density is negatively associated with electricity consumption for single-family houses, suggesting that the effect of neighborhood density is different for different types of dwelling units.},

	abstract = {The measurement and characterization of urbanization crucially depends upon defining what counts as urban. According to The Indian Planning Commission, less than a third of the Indian population lives in urban areas, and while Indian cities are increasingly important to the economy, India is perceived fundamentally as a rural country. In this paper, we show that this received wisdom is an artefact of the definition of urbanity and the official statistics vastly undercount the level of urbanization and its importance for development policies in India.We begin by creating temporally-consistent, high-resolution population maps from sub district level population data available from the Indian Census for 2001 and 2011. The modeling framework is a two-step process that applies a Random Forest-based model to generate a prediction weighting layer subsequently used to inform a gridded dasymetric redistribution of original census counts at 100 m resolution (Stevens et al. 2015). We then apply density thresholds, contiguity conditions, distance based clustering and minimum population sizes to construct urban agglomerations for the entire country. Compared to the official estimates, we find that this approach counts 8%-30% (depending on thresholds) more urban population in 2011. We find large urban agglomerations that span large portions of Kerala and the Gangetic plain. Thus, while official estimates count more cities in the country, we delineate fewer cities but large urban regions that span jurisdictional boundaries. This has implication for urban policies.},

	abstract = {Objective: To determine whether neighbourhood supermarket and convenience store availability and broader built environment context are associated with food purchasing behaviour in a national population.

 Design: We used observational data to perform a cross-sectional study of food purchases for US households in 2010. We used three-level mixed-effect regression models to determine whether the associations between the number of neighbourhood supermarkets and convenience stores and the self-reported annual household expenditures for fruits and vegetables were affected by regional destination accessibility, neighbourhood destination diversity, availability of neighbourhood destinations and neighbourhood street connectivity.

Setting: Metropolitan statistical areas (n 378) in the USA.
Participants: Households (n 22 448).

Results: Controlling for broader built environment context, there was no significant association between availability of neighbourhood supermarkets and expenditures on fruits and vegetables; instead, we observed an inverse association between the number of convenience stores and expenditures for fruits (P = 0·001). The broader built environment context was associated with food purchase, although the magnitude was small: (i) higher regional destination accessibility was associated with higher expenditures for fruits (P < 0·001); (ii) higher neighbourhood destination diversity was associated with lower expenditures for vegetables (P = 0·002); and (iii) higher neighbourhood street connectivity was  associated with higher expenditures for fruits (P < 0·001).

Conclusions: The broader built environment factors contributed to understanding how people use neighbourhood food stores. However, there was only a small relationship between the broader environment context and fruit and vegetable expenditures. Policy interventions that focus exclusively on increasing the availability of neighbourhood supermarkets likely will not promote fruit and vegetable consumption.},

In this study, we argue that plans could be evaluated using other criteria such as utility for different users. We use the energy planning of thirty-five American Indian tribes as a case study to demonstrate this evaluation methodology. American Indian tribes have used energy planning to address interdependencies of mineral rights with economic development and tribal sovereignty as well environmental stewardship under uncertainty.  Our evaluation methodology explicitly acknowledges the complexity of information presented in the plans and evaluates them holistically with an eye towards plan users, who may be different from the plan makers. We evaluate whether or not interdependencies among actions are addressed and what types of uncertainties are explicitly 15considered and in what ways. This framework helps identify how different plan elements are useful for different entities.},

	abstract = {Why are many plans not implemented? Common explanations for this question are planners have little power, or they failed to account for political or environmental uncertainty, or they failed to include to enough voices during the planning process. Weaving different strands of implementation and strategic planning literature, I provide an alternative account by challenging the premise that plans realise their potential only when they are implemented. I argue that theoretical frameworks that we base our understanding of plans and their purposes do not allow us to explain the ways in which plans are used. Monitoring implementation of plans, presupposes that we know what plans are there to monitor. It privileges published plans and ignores all the other plans that guide urban development.  By jettisoning implementation as a key criterion by which to evaluate the effectiveness of plans, we can begin to focus on myriad of ways in which plans are used by plan makers as well as others. A better question to ask is, ``How are these plans used and when are they useful?'' In asking those questions, we can create different evaluative frameworks for different types of plans. Some unimplementable plans are worth making.},

	abstract = {Abstract While urban form affects building energy consumption, the pathways, direction and magnitude of the effect are disputed in the literature. This paper uses a unique dataset to examine the effect of urban form on residential electricity consumption in Ningbo, China. Using survey and utility bill data of 534 households in 46 neighborhoods in the city, we model the electricity use of households using a multi-level regression model. We find that neighborhood street configuration and tree shade are important in controlling residential electricity consumption and, consequently, greenhouse gas emissions. Our results suggest that seasonality and dwelling type condition the effect of neighborhood densities on electricity consumption. Neighborhood density is associated with household electricity consumption in summer months, while there is no such association in the winter months. As neighborhood density increases, households in slab and tower apartments in dense urban neighborhoods consume more electricity in summer months, which can be partly explained by exacerbated heat island effect. Interestingly, the neighborhood density is negatively associated with electricity consumption for single-family houses, suggesting that the effect of neighborhood density is different for different types of dwelling units.},

	abstract = {The Department of Energy's Clean Cities program was created in 1993 to reduce petroleum usage in the transportation sector. The program promotes alternative fuels such as biofuels and fuel-saving strategies such as idle reduction and fleet management through coalitions of local government, non-profit, and private actors. Few studies have evaluated the impact of the program because of its complexity that include interrelated strategies of grants, education and training and diversity of participants. This paper uses a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach to evaluate the effectiveness of the program between 1990 and 2010. We quantify the effectiveness of the Clean Cities program by focusing on performance measures such as air quality, number of alternative fueling stations, private vehicle occupancy and transit ridership. We find that counties that participate in the program perform better on all these measures compared to counties that did not participate. Compared to the control group, counties in the Clean Cities program experienced a reduction in days with bad air quality (3.7\%), a decrease in automobile commuters (2.9\%), an overall increase in transit commuters (2.1\%) and had greater numbers of new alternative fueling stations (12.9). The results suggest that the program is a qualified success.},

@article{Lester:wp:jo,
	abstract = {Problem: Given the extent of deindustrialization since the late 1970s, many cities are forced to deal with a legacy of vacant and environmentally damaged industrial land.  Urban economic development strategies have also turned away from manufacturing, towards attracting high-skill service sector jobs. Thus, it is of no surprise that planners, to date, have been focused on converting vacant industrial parcels within the city into more `residentiary' uses and deliberately directing public infrastructure investment elsewhere.  However, the recent resurgence in manufacturing in the aftermath of the Great Recession and the transformation of many goods-producing sectors offers an opportunity that may bypass urban areas that do not preserve industrial land or view it as complementary to other uses.
Research Strategy and Findings: To this end, we develop an index of vulnerability of industrial land that is based on location factors, neighborhood dynamics, detailed industrial trends, environmental hazards, and local regulations.  We show for the cases of Cook County, IL and Mecklenburg County, NC how these factors can explain the conversion probability and how various industrial preservation strategies counteract these vulnerabilities. We use a logit model formulation with detailed parcel data and establishment time series data to derive the index of vulnerability.
Takeaway for Practice: This index can be used to strategically plan for which industries to target and which sites to preserve as industrial uses. The statistical models suggest that traditional planning and regulatory tools such as industrial zone designations do reduce conversion risk and factors such as transit accessibility increase the vulnerability of conversion. We argue that local governments should be strategic about which manufacturing industries can be preserved at what locations using these tools. We also develop and demonstrate an open source interactive web-based tool that demonstrates some of the key concepts that can be replicated in other places.

However, in adapting scenario planning from its origins in the business sector, planners have eliminated two key components: 1) the use of multiple scenarios, and 2) the inclusion of diverse organisations, people and interests through deep deliberations. We argue that this shift limits the ability for planners to plan for multiple plausible and futures that are shaped by an increasing number of diverse actors. In this paper, we use case study research to exam how uncertainty was considered in four scenario planning processes. We analyzed and compared the cases based analytical categories related to multiple futures and diversity. We found that the processes that used multiple, structurally distinct scenarios explored a wider range of topics and issues shaping places. All four relied heavily on professional stakeholders as the scenario developers, limiting public input. Only those processes that included multiple futures captured the differential effects scenarios would have on diverse people and interests. },

The paper analyzes the results of a survey of various tribes and energy resource development and planning efforts and supplements the responses with publicly available information on resources, economics, and demographics. We find that incentives and advisory services from the federal government are key to developing the capacity of the tribes to pursue energy planning and energy resource development. These incentives largely avoid the misdeeds of past federal policy by promoting tribal control over energy planning and energy resource development efforts. Tribes with formal energy plans or visions are more likely to develop energy resources than tribes without them and are engaged in a more comprehensive and sustainable approach to energy resource development and energy efficiency.},

They argue that compact housing and urban patterns reduce both household and transportation energy use and should be promoted to combat a variety of ills, including energy import dependency and climate change. However, planners also have a strong role to play in energy production, particularly with the increasing adoption of renewable forms of energy. Planners will play an integral part in harmonising local land use regulations and policies that will either promote or hinder these technologies. In this paper, we survey the literature and point to environmental and other land use issues that are pertinent to different types of centralised, distributed, conventional and renewable energy production.

	abstract = {Recently, as part of his Climate Action Plan, the Obama administration proposed that energy efficiency should be factored into mortgage underwriting upon the sale or refinancing of new and existing homes. Unfortunately, there is little empirical evidence on the relationship between energy efficiency and mortgage risks. Utilizing a unique dataset, we examine this relationship. More narrowly, we examine the performance of mortgages backed by Energy Star certified homes. We find that default and prepayment risks are significantly lower in certified homes. Even for Energy Star certified homes, more energy efficiency is associated with even lower loan risks.  These results offer support for taking energy efficiency into consideration in the mortgage underwriting process. Being the first of its kind, further research needs to replicate the present study with other data sets, over different time periods, and with alternative methodologies.

	abstract = {Plans provide information about how multiple decisions are structured over time, and what the intentions of a particular actor are. As and when these decisions get made, or not made, some parts of plans become irrelevant, while some other new relationships are discovered and considered. Recognising this provides a useful way to interpret the changes in plans by tracking the decisions and vice versa. In this paper, we illustrate the complexities of an ontology of urban systems which are needed to ensure the currency of plans, so that they could be effectively used in urban decision making. Especially, when actors are numerous, jurisdictions overlap, actions are interdependent and interests are unstable, this framework enables us to think about plans in a complex and changing urban environment and make them so that they remain useful.},

Peak oil will affect the general economy, travel behavior, and urban form through income and substitution effects; however, because of the wide range of substitution possibilities, the impacts are likely to be gradual and relatively small. Furthermore, we suggest that changes in travel behavior and increases in urban density will have both favorable and unfavorable effects on public health. To mitigate the adverse impacts and to maximize the positive effects of peak oil, we recommend that careful attention should be paid to urban design and public health responses for a range of urbanization patterns.},

	abstract = {If urban development plans were just target patterns to be achieved, conventional data structures in GIS would be sufficient. Urban development plans have a strong spatial component, but recent literature in planning emphasizes that plans are about actions and relationships among them. These relationships include interdependence, substitutability, priority, and parthood. In order to support planning, GIScience should devise data structures and queries to support reasoning with these relationships. This paper shows how relationships encoded within each of a set of plans, using a recently developed data model, can be used to infer the relationships of actions among these plans. Simple databases and use cases based on real situations in McHenry County, Illinois are used to demonstrate that these relationships can be encoded and queried. The results demonstrate that previously dis- covered semantic relationships can be used to discover additional relationships across plans, thereby enriching the decision making. The approach provides a systematic way of structuring the information in plans to support making and using plans.},

	abstract = {Historic reference behavior and archetypes of system structure are key tools for creating rigorous system dynamics (SD) models. Modelers often delineate causal relationships by employing common archetypes of dynamic system structure, which produce behaviors such as growth and decline, oscillation, and complex combinations thereof. We extend archetypes to spatial-dynamic models, focusing on structural archetypes that exhibit changing spatial patterns in two-dimensional landscapes. Although many fields employ spatial modeling techniques, analogy-based, causally focused system archetypes remain confined to non-spatial SD models. We draw on spatial analysis literature to explore the influence of space on dynamic relationships and archetypes, including methods for articulating {\`O}space{\'O} and expressing feedback. We offer simple examples of spatial system archetypes and explore network structures for spatially extending SD models. By doing this, we argue for spatial modeling techniques that parallel the learn-by-analogy environment that archetypes have promoted in aspatial SD research.},

	abstract = {U.S. regulations require offsets for aquatic ecosystems damaged during land development, often through restoration of alternative resources. What effect does large scale wetland and stream restoration have on surrounding land values? Restoration effects on real estate values have substantial implications for protecting resources, increasing tax base, and improving environmental policies. Our analysis focuses on the three county Raleigh---Durham--Chapel Hill, North Carolina region, which has experienced rapid development and extensive aquatic ecological restoration (through the state's Ecosystem Enhancement Program [EEP]). Since restoration sites are not randomly distributed across space, we used a genetic algorithm to match parcels near restoration sites with comparable control parcels. Similar to propensity score analysis, this technique facilitates statistical comparison and isolates the effects of restoration sites on surrounding real estate values.
Compared to parcels not proximate to any aquatic resources, we found that, 1) natural aquatic systems steadily and significantly increase parcel values up to 0.75 miles away, and 2) parcels < 0.5 mi from EEP restoration sites have significantly lower sale prices, while 3) parcels > 0.5 mi from EEP sites gain substantial amenity value. When we control for intervening water bodies (e.g. unrestored streams and wetlands), we find a similar inflection point whereby parcels < 0.5 mi from EEP sites exhibit lower values, and sites 0.5-- 0.75 mi away exhibit increased values. Our work points to the need for higher public visibility of aquatic ecosystem restoration programs and increased public information about their value.},

Participatory planning processes building upon these ideas argue that planning itself has to be communicative among a variety of interest groups and should, usually, result in a common consensus. However, the boundaries of these groups rarely get attention. These boundaries shape not only the discursive practices within groups but also among them, and therefore need to be examined more thoroughly. Furthermore, the relationship of membership to substantive issues of planning is important yet underexplored. Political membership in a diverse, mobile, transient and multi-cultural world is a contested subject and should be given deserving attention for its implications for planning practice.},

Current information technologies, the Internet and the World Wide Web in particular, make access to data from such disparate sources feasible. Using these technologies to implement a `system of plans' approach to urban development planning will, however, require a widely shared data model for structuring the content and meanings of plans and regulations and a widely shared language, based on this data model. This paper presents an initial version of a planning data model (PDM), several use cases that set the scope of such a data model, and illustrations of how the current version of the PDM supports these use cases. Further work can build on this data model, including an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) implementation for sharing the information. These tools will enable urban development decision makers to conceive of planning as involving many actors whose many plans can provide useful and usable information.},

	abstract = {The literature on planning assumes that plans, to be useful, should be public and then implemented. The participatory paradigm, with its recent resurgence, assumes that planning should be performed with stakeholders in public forums. This paper challenges the notion that plans and planning processes should be public in general or even within a group whose mandate it is to plan. It considers the inherent strategic reality of planning and interactions of multiple plans, existing and being made and being discarded, to argue for cases in which plans are and ought to be private and planning necessarily strategic and idiosyncratic. This paper addresses questions such as: In what circumstances will a plan maker choose to make plans public, to whom, and when? What should we expect to be public from the plans of others and what not? This paper will posit that plans are subsumed in plans about plans and that plans are strategically made explicit in public. The absence of public documents in particular situations should not be taken to imply that plans do not exist or that plan led behaviour is not occurring, inferable, or observable. Based in part on examples from New Orleans recovery planning, we then provide explanations of why and in what circumstances individuals, voluntary groups, and governments are likely to plan in public and make plans public. And we consider related but distinct justifications for what aspects of plans should be made public and in what circumstances.},

	abstract = {Residential energy consumption accounts for 22\% of the total energy consumption in the US. However, the impacts of local planning policies, such as increasing density and changing the housing type mix, on residential energy consumption are not well understood. Using Residential Energy Consumption Survey Data from the Energy Information Administration, quantile regression analysis was used to tease out the effects of various factors on entire distribution on the energy consumption spectrum instead of focusing on the conditional average. Results show that while housing size matters for space conditioning, housing type has a more nuanced impact. Self-reported neighborhood density does not seem to have any impact on energy use. Furthermore, the effects of these factors at the tails of the energy use distribution are substantially different than the average, in some cases differing by a factor of six. Some, not all, types of multifamily housing offer almost as much savings as reduction in housing area by 100 m2, compared to single family houses.},

@incollection{kaza_knaap_2011,
	abstract = {The literature in economics and planning contains advice that seems to hinge upon the distinctions between planning and market approaches to public policy. In these distinctions, the planning approach is often characterized as stiffly regulatory while the market approach is characterized as more flexible and thus usually preferable. This distinction, we argue, is false both in its positive formulation and in its normative implication that the market approach is always superior. Instead, we assert planning is not about market failures and regulatory remedies but can be better understood by several other economic principles. These include the Coasian notion of transaction costs, the problem of optimization over time, and the problem of non-cooperative games in which the public sector is but one of many players. We argue plans and planning make sense in both situations where single or multiple actors think before acting, using limited information. When viewed in these frameworks, we argue that research by planners and economists are much stronger complements than they are substitutes.},

@article{Chakraborty:2011lr,
	abstract = {Problem: The practice of scenario plan- ning is often too focused on developing a single preferred scenario and fails to adequately consider multiple uncertain futures. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development recently awarded grants for scenario planning at regional and metropolitan scales that further promote this practice. However, a lack of systematic analysis of uncertainty limits the role of scenario planning.

Purpose: The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how to incorporate uncertainty into large-scale scenario analysis and then use that framework to identify contingent and robust plans.

Methods: We adapt the concepts of controllable internal options and uncontrol- lable external forces and consider their interactions in order to develop future scenarios and identify contingent and robust decisions. We then apply this technique using advanced econometric, land use, and transportation models developed for the Baltimore--Washington metropolitan region and its vicinity. Finally, based on the results of a hypothetical, yet plausible, exercise, we show how contingent and robust decisions can help local and regional governments develop contingent and robust plans.

 Results and conclusions: Scenarios developed as a combination of internal options and external forces allow us to identify a wider range of future impacts than in traditional metropolitan scenario planning. Robust plans support choices that offer benefits across scenarios. Contingent plans can be tailored to specific futures.

Takeaway for practice: By providing a way to think systematically about uncer-
tainty, scenario analysis promises to improve the efficacy of large-scale planning. },

	abstract = {Sprawling urbanisation has been the hallmark of development in United States. This study intends to provide a comprehensive overview of the changing urban landscape pat- terns between 2001 and 2006. Using the land cover data from US Geological Survey for these two years, I characterise the landscape metrics for each county in the continental United States. The changes in these metrics are correlated with the drivers of urbani- sation including socioeconomic variables. Uneven and heterogeneous patterns of growth in a country this large are not surprising. However, the metrics reveal that while urban counties are becoming less fragmented, some rural counties in South and Western United States are experiencing significant leapfrog development.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the spatial and temporal patterns of green building in the commercial and institutional sector in the U.S. While these buildings are becoming more common place, they have yet to reach a critical mass to affect the entire construction industry. Given the potential for green building practices to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, we seek to understand the geography of green building. Using multiple metrics, we explain the patterning of geography of LEED and Energy Star certified buildings in the United States. We find strong evidence of clustering at the metropolitan and sub-metropolitan scales. This exploratory research serves as a foundation for future research aimed at specifying the nature of agglomerative processes in green buildings.},

@article{Kaza:TDA,
	abstract = {Many place based accessibility studies ignore the time component. Relying on theoretical frameworks that treat distance between two fixed points as constant, these methods ignore the diurnal and seasonal changes in accessibility. Furthermore, network distances between two nodes are dependent on the network structure and weight distribution on the edges. These weights can change quite frequently and the network structure itself is subject to modification because of availability and unavailability of links and nodes. All these reasons, point to considering the implications of time variation in accessibility of a place. Using the case of transit, where all these feature are readily apparent simultaneously, I demonstrate the volatility in accessibility for two counties in North Carolina. Significant diurnal changes are observed in quarter of the locations and in the rest the changes are minimal mostly because of low levels of transit accessibility. I argue not for minimizing the volatility, but for acknowledging its impacts on mode choices, location choices and therefore on spatial structure of cities.},

@article{Kaza:EDQ,
	abstract = {In the years since Michael Porter's paper about the potential competitiveness of inner cities there has been growing evidence of a residential resurgence in urban neighborhoods.  Yet, there is less evidence on the competitiveness of inner cities for employment.  We document the trends in net employment growth and find that inner cities gained over 1.8 million jobs between 2002 and 2011 at a rate comparable to suburban areas.  We also find a significant number of inner cities are becoming more competitive over this period---increasing their share of metropolitan employment in 120 out of 281 MSAs.  We also describe the pattern of job growth within the inner city, finding that tracts that grew faster tended to be closer to downtown, with access to transit, and adjacent to areas with higher population growth.  However, tracts with higher poverty rates experienced less job growth, indicating that barriers still exist in the inner city. },
